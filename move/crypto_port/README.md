Contracts requirements:

The smart contracts provided consist of two contracts: Fare and Ride. Here are the requirements of these contracts:

Fare Contract:

The Fare contract inherits the OwnableUpgradeable contract for ownership control functionalities and implements the IFare interface.
The Fare contract stores parameters for different car types and fare details for each ride.
It allows the contract owner to set the ride contract address through the setRideContractAddress function.
The contract owner can set parameters for different car types using the setCarTypeParameters function.
The storeBaseFare function is called by the ride contract to calculate and store the base fare for a ride. It considers the car type, estimated distance, estimated time, boost percent, additional charges, and discounted deductions.
The addCounterQuote function is called by the ride contract to add a driver's counter quote for a ride. The counter quote includes the driver's address and boost percent.
The storeEstimatedFare function is called by the ride contract to calculate and store the estimated fare for a ride. It considers the base fare, chosen boost percent, additional charges, and discounted deductions.
The storeFinalFare function is called by the ride contract to calculate and store the final fare for a ride. It considers the car type, actual distance, actual time, additional charges, and discounted deductions.
The baseFareCalculation function calculates the base fare for a ride based on the car type, time, and distance.
The calculateEstimatedFare function calculates the estimated fare of a ride based on the base fare, boost percentage, additional charges, and discounted deductions.
The getEstimatedFare function calculates the estimated fare for a specific car type, time, distance, boost percentage, additional charges, and discounted deductions.
Ride Contract:

The Ride contract inherits the OwnableUpgradeable contract for ownership control functionalities.
The Ride contract stores ride data and manages the lifecycle of a ride.
It allows the contract owner to set the fare contract address through the setFareContractAddress function.
The requestRide function is called by a rider to request a ride. It sets the initial ride data and emits the Ride_Requested event.
The counterQuote function is called by the fare contract to provide a counter quote for a ride. It sets the boost percent for the ride and emits the Counter_Quoted event.
The acceptRide function is called by a driver to accept a ride. It sets the driver for the ride and updates the ride state.
The completeRide function is called by the fare contract to mark a ride as successfully completed. It sets the final distance, final time, and updates the ride state.
The cancelRideByRider function is called by the rider to cancel a ride. It updates the ride state and emits an event.
The cancelRideByDriver function is called by the driver to cancel a ride. It updates the ride state and emits an event.
The cancelRideByCRYPTOPORT function is called by the fare contract to cancel a ride due to an error. It updates the ride state and emits an event.
